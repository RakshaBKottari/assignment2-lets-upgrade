       <p>SD big shot Willy Lages knew that ‘the caller’ was a well-known informant.
This theory continues on an assumption that in itself is insufficiently proven, that is that betrayal by telephone led to the raid.
In 1963, the National Police Internal Investigation Department investigated the raid. They asked SD chief Willy Lages whether it was common for his former service to jump to action upon receiving a telephone tip-off about people in hiding. Lages answered that the credibility of the tip-off would have been checked first, unless it came from an informant who had proved to be reliable before. In other words: If a call was actually made that morning, and the response was immediate, then one may conclude that the informant was known and reliable, according to Lages. He only stuck to the logic of assumptions of which he did not know the validity, nor did he need to know the validity in order to give a reasoned answer. </p> <p>According to another story, the SD officer who took the alleged call said that he had spoken to a woman. This officer, Julius Dettmann, died in his cell a few weeks after the liberation. Silberbauer stated that Dettmann never told him who had made the call. The story about the female voice came from someone who allegedly told Otto Frank about it. However, there is no evidence to this effect.</p>
